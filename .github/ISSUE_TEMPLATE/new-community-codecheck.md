<!-- Thank you for starting a codecheck community workflow! See https://codecheck.org.uk/guide/community-process for the full documentation. These HTML commments will not render in the issue, but you can delete them once you've read them if you prefer! -->

<!-- Certificate identifier in the form `YYYY-NNN` is documented in the issue title; try to derive the next certificate identifier, the CODECHECK editor will double check; if you need to enter a range, seperate the first and last complete ID by a "/", e.g., 2025-111/2025-222 -->

**Repository**: ... <!-- link to the repository in the codecheckers organisation with the code; if you do not have access reach out to Daniel (https://github.com/nuest/) please. -->

**Workflow**: ... <!-- short description of the code to be checked, e.g., title of the paper, link to preprint or published article, extra links to data repositories, etc. -->

<!-- Do you have suggestions for potential codecheckers? Mention them here! -->
