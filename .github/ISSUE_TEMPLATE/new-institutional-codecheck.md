<!-- Thank you for starting a codecheck institutional workflow! See https://codecheck.org.uk/guide/community-process for the full documentation of the community workflow, which likely matches closely how your institution interacts with CODECHECK. These HTML commments will not render in the issue, but you can delete them once you've read them if you prefer! -->

**Repository**: ... <!-- link to the repository in the codecheckers organisation with the code; if you do not have access reach out to Daniel (https://github.com/nuest/) please. -->

**Certificate draft** (if applicable): ... <!-- link to the draft certificate on Zenodo/OSF, if you already have one; please consider holding back on the publishing until the editor could take a quick look -->

<!-- Certificate identifier in the form `YYYY-NNN` is documented in the issue title; try to derive the next certificate identifier, the CODECHECK editor will double check; if you need to enter a range, seperate the first and last complete ID by a "/", e.g., 2025-111/2025-222 -->

**Institution**: ... <!-- short name of the institution where the codecheck is conducted, see the list of existing ones https://codecheck.org.uk/register/venues/institutions/ -->
