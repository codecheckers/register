      "text": "<jats:p>Abstract. Given the challenge of visualising 3D space on a 2D map, maps used for in-flight navigation by pilots should be designed especially carefully. This paper studies, based on existing aeronautical charts, the visualisation, interaction, and interpretation of airspace structures with aviation infrastructure and the base map.We first developed a three-tiered evaluation grid for a cartographic analysis of existing aeronautical charts. Subsequently, we evaluated four countries’ maps based on our evaluation grid. To validate our analysis, we conducted a user study with 27 pilots, the users of aeronautical charts.The results of our cartographic analysis show that aeronautical charts produced by different countries all fulfil the need of pilots being able to orient themselves. According to our evaluation, the Swiss aeronautical chart scored slightly more favourably than the other evaluated charts for effective map-reading. These findings were confirmed in the results of the user study.The major contribution of this work is the evaluation grid for the cartographic analysis. With its different layers, adaptable main- and sub-topics, it can be used to compare and improve the design not only of aeronautical charts, but for a broad spectrum of thematic maps.\n                    <\/jats:p>",

    "summary": "The purpose of the reviewed article is to evaluate and compare airspace structure visualization and perception on digital aeronautical charts.\nTo do so, the authors propose two ways.\nThe first one aims to define an evaluation grid on which they rely, as experts, to establish a cartographic analysis (they authors provide an access to their analysis).\nThe second is a survey of 27 airplane pilots to collect their perceptions about different maps.\nTherefore, the reproducibility review process focused on reproducing the result visualizations of both analyses (the experts and the survey).\nTo do so, the authors shared manually constructed data files as well as code files to reproduce the figures.\nThe provided code and data allow to fully and easily reproduce the three figures of the reviewed article.\n",
