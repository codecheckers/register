      "text": "<jats:p>Abstract. Spatial information has gained more attention in natural language processing tasks in different interdisciplinary domains. Moreover, the spatial information is available in two forms: Absolute Spatial Information (ASI) e.g., Paris, London, and Germany and Relative Spatial Information (RSI) e.g., south of Paris, north Madrid and 80 km from Rome. Therefore, it is challenging to extract RSI from textual data and compute its geotagging. This paper presents two strategies and the associated prototypes to address the following tasks: 1) extraction of relative spatial information from textual data and 2) geotagging of this relative spatial information. Experiments show promising results for RSI extraction and tagging.\n                    <\/jats:p>",

The repositories are well documented.\nI was able to clone the repositories and run the code, reproducing examples demonstrated on figures in the paper.\nOne of the reproduced figures differed from the one presented in the paper. \nThe tables demonstrating results of the evaluation of the app were partially reproducible but returned slightly different values.\nThe paper has been partially reproduced.\n",
