      "text": "<jats:p>Abstract. The transportation dynamics within a European city, Vienna, are examined using a multi-graph representation of the city’s network. The focus is on time-optimized routing algorithms and the effects of altering the average waiting penalty at traffic lights. The impact of these modifications, whether an increase to 60, 90, or even 150 seconds or a decrease to 10 seconds, is observed in the selection of transportation modes and routes for identical origin and destination pairs. The investigation also extends to whether routes shift towards secondary street networks to avoid traffic lights as the waiting penalty increases. Experimental variations in average waiting time for cars aim to uncover detailed effects on transportation mode choices, route length and time changes, and variations in human energy expenditure. These findings could provide valuable insights into the transportation network and its possibilities and help in urban planning and policy development. The results indicate a shift in transportation mode as the waiting penalty for cars at traffic lights increases, and in some instances, routes are redirected to roads of lower importance such as residential or service roads. \n                    <\/jats:p>",
